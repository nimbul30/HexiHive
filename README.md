Curation replaces the algorithm.
HexiHive is a creator-driven, modular social platform where users explore and build "Hexis" — themed content hubs — connected by human-curated trails, not black-box algorithms.

🚀 What is HexiHive?
Tired of algorithm-manipulated feeds? So are we.
HexiHive is a fast, functional discovery playground where:

✅ Creators build Hexis — modular pages for music, videos, opinions, or anything else
✅ Users explore content through social trails and taste tags, not endless feeds
✅ Influence is measured by real engagement, not just likes
✅ Curation is the core — not AI guesswork
